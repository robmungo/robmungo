- 👋 Hi, I’m @robmungo
- 👀 I’m interested in Ubuntu Linux. Back in mid-1980s I developed business apps, e.g. payroll on Xenix/C,
      I'm burnt out as a coder now, and forgotten more than I once knew! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, trying to install Anbox on Ubuntu 20 LTS, getting stuck. Maybe need to uninstall and re-install?!
- 💞️ Recently, I developed sales order processing and documents management app for sales reps of veterinary equipment for iPad app with Filemaker
      (Apple-owned, i developed on Windows platform). Its script language is restricted, can be a right pain. I built in a flexible
      app settings management module in last version, so it could be streamlined easily into a generic sales order processing and invoicing system.
      But not server-integrated. Designed for field sales with no dependency on internet connection! So, if anyone wants collaboration with Filemaker
      project, client-side?!
- 📫 How to reach me, email robthorburn@btinternet.com, no response guaranteed...
